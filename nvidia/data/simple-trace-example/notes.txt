Questions:

1. Only cares about LDG and STG

2. What are the diffs between []*writearound.Comp / []*writethrough.Comp / []*writeback.Comp?
Shall we utilize it for implementing the L1 and L2 cache?

3. Do we need to separate v/s/i cache & addressing for L1 and L2?

l1vCaches               []*writearound.Comp
l1sCaches               []*writethrough.Comp
l1iCaches               []*writethrough.Comp
l2Caches                []*writeback.Comp

4. L2 has num mem bank






###########################################

MOV: Moves data between registers
IMAD: Integer Multiply-Add, a commonly used operation in vector processing.
LDG: Load global memory (this is where cache effects are important).
FADD: Floating-point addition

L1: Fast. Each SM has its own L1 cache.
L2: Larger but slower. L2 cache is shared across all SMs
Global Mem: A L2 cache miss leads to access to the much slower global memory.
