# Rodinia HotSpot

CUDA host program `hotspot.cu` for the Rodinia HotSpot benchmark. The GPU kernels are not copied: `hotspot.cu` `#include`s the HIP kernel file of the AMD benchmark, which nvcc compiles unchanged through `../../include/hip/hip_runtime.h`.

## Differences from the AMD host code

None beyond the common ones below.

Common to all ports: Device buffers that the AMD driver hands out zeroed are cleared with `cudaMemset`; results are checked on the host with the relative-error rule of the Go `Verify` (`|ref - got| / max(|ref|, 1)`), with the reference accumulated in double where that avoids false mismatches.

## Verification status

- Compiles as CUDA (host and device) under clang `-fsyntax-only`.
- Prints `Passed!` when run on a CPU emulation of CUDA with the default arguments.
- Not yet built with nvcc or run on an NVIDIA GPU.
